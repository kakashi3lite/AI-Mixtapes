# AI-Mixtapes Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the AI-Mixtapes application architecture.

## Core Components

*   **Audio Processing Module:** Handles audio analysis, feature extraction, and mood detection.
*   **AI Integration Service:** Manages interactions with AI models for playlist generation and recommendations.
*   **Core Data Module:** Manages persistent storage for user data, mixtapes, and audio features.
*   **MusicKit Module:** Integrates with Apple Music for playback and library management.
*   **Visualization Module:** Renders audio visualizations and user interface elements.

## Data Flow

1.  User selects audio for analysis.
2.  Audio Processing Module extracts features and detects mood.
3.  AI Integration Service uses mood and user preferences to generate a playlist.
4.  MusicKit Module plays the generated playlist.
5.  Visualization Module displays real-time audio visualizations.

## Design Principles

*   **Modularity:** Components are designed to be independent and reusable.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture supports future expansion and integration of new AI models.
*   **Performance:** Optimized for real-time audio processing and responsive user experience.
*   **Testability:** Each component is designed for easy unit and integration testing.
